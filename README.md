# Crowdfunding - Demo - Solidity
This smart contract demo regulates a decentralized crowdfunding platform.

The following requirements are satisfied:
- The smart contract is initialized with a given deadline and a minimum contribution per user.
- Each contributor can contribute as much as they can, and a contributor count is kept
- The recipient must create spending requests to spend the crowdfunded money. Those requests can then be accepted or rejected by the contributors.
- Finally, if the raised amount is less than the goal or if the deadline has passed, the contributors can request a refund.
